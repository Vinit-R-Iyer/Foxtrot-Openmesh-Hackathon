# Foxtrot-Openmesh-Hackathon

This Repository is a shared repository for the Hackathon Challenge 01 of Openmesh.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

```shell
npm i
```

Then

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
